This is a (not so) simple API for Minecraft 1.20.1 that adds the ability to create custom drink items.

Using these drink items you can add custom data driven additions to each drink that will have different effects on the user upon consuming.  Additions can be added to drinks using the new `Drink Workstation` block.  By itself this mod doesn't add any customizable drinks, and you will need another mod like Pluto's Coffee Mod or Tea Time in order to use it.

Each addition can have many different effects, including dealing damage, applying status effects, restoring hunger, clearing effects, and teleportation.  With a Fabric Mod based on this API you can add more On Drink Templates for even more in-depth Add-ins.  Add ins can also be registered in code.

A Wiki for this API is coming soon...
